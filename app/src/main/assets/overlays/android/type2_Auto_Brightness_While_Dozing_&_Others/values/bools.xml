         after the warm-up interface and the screen brightness will be adjusted immediately.
         If this flag is false, then the ambient light level estimate will be adjusted more
         gradually in the same manner that normally happens when the screen is on according to the
         brightening or dimming debounce thresholds.  As a result, it may take somewhat longer to
         adapt to the environment.  This mode may be better suited for watches. -->
